The Efreti didn't seem to take seeing a human using one of their kins Worldships very well.`

All the proof they found from your crew, flight logs and records, points to the fact that you could have only gained the ship from slaughtering the inhabitants. The trial is quickly ended with the Efret dragging you off with a sentence of life imprisonment.`
			`	Your days from then onward are spent in a tightly controlled prison complex. The conditions are harsh but the Efret at least try to treat you with care. You are left only to wonder what you could have achieved as a captain if this wasn't your fate.`

Unless you can provide evidence that you obtained this ship without committing a genocide, we are forced to take you into custody."`
			`	They don't allow you to get as much as a word out before one of the guards has locked your arms behind your back, completely halting your attempts to fight back with surprisingly little effort. You are brought before something akin to a Quarg jury, where it is quickly proven beyond a doubt that you could not have obtained the ship without a mass slaughter, they condemn your actions as unjustifiable and unforgivable in a long lecture. At the end of it all, they sentence you to life imprisonment.`
			`	You spend the rest of your days in the same cell, which although large and comfortable, quickly proves plain and dull. You're kept in very good health and are well-fed, but the Quarg do not allow you to leave the cell and seldom entertain your attempts at striking conversation. You get few visitors and can only wonder what life would've been like had you the chance to live out all these years in freedom, the captain of a starship.`
